### About me

I aim to kickstart a professional career in frontend development, leveraging my web development skills to foster business growth, while actively pursuing continuous learning and development in this field.

My journey in programming began in 2009 when I worked as an HTML coder for the official website of the university where I earned my degree in finance. Later, I worked in the finance department of a large holding company. My responsibilities included analyzing and optimizing business processes using Visual Basic, Python, and SQL. Since 2020, I have been an entrepreneur in the field of machine embroidery, which has given me valuable experience in graphic design and international trade.

At all stages of my way, programming has played a key role. My strength lies in my ability to identify opportunities for business process optimization, with programming being a tool for improving efficiency. I am attracted to the dynamic and constantly evolving environment of frontend development, which offers numerous opportunities for growth and creativity. I value the practical focus of this field, which allows for relatively quick visibility and assessment of work results. At the same time, I am interested in programming theory and JavaScript in particular, as I believe that a clear understanding of how things work enables achieving high results in development.
